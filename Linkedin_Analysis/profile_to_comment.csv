One is you would have to know how much is to much. When jobs are created the salary is detriment by what is required. Meaning how hard is the job and how intensive the job can be. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the sad part there\xe2\x80\x99s are a lot of loopholes employers can take both legally and illegally. I\xe2\x80\x99m only guessing when you did had jobs and were treated like Cinderella it\xe2\x80\x99s because they knew that you were willing to. As for moving up here\xe2\x80\x99s what a lot of people don\xe2\x80\x99t get. To move up in the company you would have to apply for the higher position. Most employers have a policy that they would have to post a position for a certain amount of days before they can start interviewing. Since we both agree that it\xe2\x80\x99s expensive to hire an external applicant but it\xe2\x80\x99s actually cheaper and easier for the company to hire or promote from within. The point I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is when taking advantage of go through the steps and not resolve then go to the next step.  Eventually it would get resolved. Also I would advise you to let employers know about your disability.'

My best advice is to use it as a reference meaning use it as a way to help both you and the company and don\xe2\x80\x99t use it as an excuse or crutch. If I\xe2\x80\x99m right delexia is where people have trouble with writing and understand words. So it would take you longer than others to do write reports and stuff. What I would do is something like this. Tell them that you can try and do it. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t make the deadline give then ask if you can have more time or help. Even though it\xe2\x80\x99s not guaranteed but they would most likely give you more time or help to make the deadline. Also if you do get a supervisor that would go to bat for you and stick up for you. In other words have your back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t sign any disciplinary action against you until you have talk to him. Sometimes depending on the person they would take it upon themselves within their authority to make sure that you can be done within the time frame allowed.'

However, the most rewarding operations that I have come to know, have made the inclusion of HR Directors as strategic business partners.  This new concept has required that we discuss the stats you mention on a regular basis.  Doing this helps prevent the whole reaction's predicament.  We learn collectively to resort to the evaluation of performance and commend achievement consistently.  Address areas of opportunity by providing access to training, Sure right now this scenario is not the norm and unfortunately small businesses seldom embrace this, but I chose to encourage consistency in the evaluation of all corporate processes to identify opportunities and prevent chaos."""
