By analyzing their current sales processes, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing effective marketing strategies, companies can dramatically increase their bottom line

The Problem

Many businesses rely on one major activity to generate their revenues

This activity, drives the majority of its revenue generation

However, relying solely on this activity can be risky and limit the potential for growth

To scale a business, it is important to diversify revenue streams and explore new opportunities

There are >43 strategies that can help businesses implement, 24 of which require no financial investment

These strategies can be grouped into three main categories: increasing sales, reducing costs, and improving operations

1.	Increasing sales
2.	Reducing costs:
3.	Improving operations:

Utilising the above, means that businesses can scale without having to spend money on Marketing / Sales / Ads or chasing new customers

Instead, they can focus on utilizing their existing resources more effectively

Relying on one major activity to generate revenues is risky for businesses

To scale, it is important to diversify revenue streams

https://www.linkedin.com/in/donovanrjohnson/,"""LaDonya Soul Stanley HR can DO better by actually backing the employee in these times, rather than management. Here's why I say this... Everyone in any kind of leadership role always defaults to making their job easier.  But, if your job is to lead, manage and motivate, should that actually BE an easier task??  And isn't this why you get paid more? When I was working in leadership, I had one issue... those that flat out refused to take direction.  Short of that, you can bring a complaint to me. You can tell me I was using you wrong. You could tell me you needed more training -- and at the time, my team told me [and I agreed with them, going to my leadership with the request, and when I found a work around to get my guys more training that didn't cost US more money, I got it approved.  They were very happy with me in that instance].   The only time we had major problems, is when I had a few engineers that refused the tasks I asked with no explanation.  [And I asked, repeatedly].Up until that point, I took it on the chin for my team when we didn't meet the mark, even if it was requirements that were set before they were even on the team.I am not patting myself on the back, but I expected responsibility for outcomes.""",,"Donovan Johnson is an enterprise technology strategist with diverse skillset that includes Hybrid Cloud, HCI, Big Data Infrastructure Design, SDN, & Microservices as well as Business Process Improvement.

To some people (including one of the Senior Directors of where I used to work), Statistics is the skill of how to lie (and that was why we were in conflict, because I was asked to do so!); but to me Statistics is to observe the samples and then judge (and therefore generalize the result of analysis to the population). My observations about HR Managers prevent me not rejecting any optimistic assumption about their work attitude; p-value never equals to 0 though! I would be delighted to meet, know and host (as a guest in my house for a month) if a HR Manager can honestly claim that they have ""never"" been unfairly biased in favour of a Senior Director against a poor low/mid level employee.

The HR manager does not know the value of the Firm\'s Statistician who can also perform their project in Fluid Mechanics! Therefore, the outcome is that in any work/salary argument between a psycho Senior Director and a lower level employee the one who receives the HR manager\'s support is the former, regardless of the validity of the points raised by the latter, and purely because the ""Senior Director"" is ""Senior Director"", and even regardless of who among those two people is the source of wealth to the business.'",,"A highly competent Statistician, also with background in Actuarial Science, Socio-economic Systems Analysis, Econometrics, and Engineering.

I live by the three essential qualities of customer service that center around 3-P’s: Professionalism, Patience, and a People-First Attitude.

Professionalism: The attitude you take towards your customers (even when they are upset). Ask me how I raised customer satisfaction scores by 35%.

Patience: Remember, EVERY customer is different! Ask me how I was able to help another company increase their customer survey scores by 37%.

People-First Attitude: Building off professionalism and patience, I create customer service strategies that reinforce the idea of human connection. Ask me how I was able to turn around a company by safeguarding $750,000 USD in relationships.

Working with me is like working with your best (quirky) friend. I bring my whole self to work and make sure everyone around me feels comfortable doing the same. And just think, you could be witness to my quirkiness with some of my favorite sayings like, “Easy things for me to say: ‘I’m sorry,’ ‘I was wrong,’ and ‘Worcestershire sauce.’” 

Fun facts: I worked at Disneyland as a Cast Member, which built the foundation for all I know about customer service delivery and storytelling. I have a library of 3,000+ books. I'm sophisticated -- I've worn black since I was 12. And I’m hooked on Netflix’s The Crown, Lucifer, Hollywood, Sex Education, and Bridgerton.

It would have to looked at similar to full time employees and part time employees. If the employee was part time it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter per say, but in general it is cheaper to give the employees what they want if you have something to back it up. As an example just asking for a raise because the cost of living is to high and you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live with in your means that gives the power to the company and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a chance. If you asked for a raise because you have some how boosted up sales then you do. In other words the concord Lowes pretty much get trucks 7 days a week. The night crew have to do both unloading trucks and stocking all in 8 hours. We used to get everything done before our shift ends no matter what size of the truck but now it\xe2\x80\x99s a gamble.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/lore-gonzalez-phd/,"""Bahman Honari I understand your reasoning.  However, the most rewarding operations that I have come to know, have made the inclusion of HR Directors as strategic business partners.  This new concept has required that we discuss the stats you mention on a regular basis.  Doing this helps prevent the whole reaction's predicament.  We learn collectively to resort to the evaluation of performance and commend achievement consistently.  Address areas of opportunity by providing access to training, Sure right now this scenario is not the norm and unfortunately small businesses seldom embrace this, but I chose to encourage consistency in the evaluation of all corporate processes to identify opportunities and prevent chaos.""",,"BDM / Passionate about Training / Human Resources Administrator /
